This reporsitory is about studying algebraic geometry through phase change, involving topological transformations. 
One can think of this as water transforming from ice to liquid to gas, and back. What can a neioghborhood expect, algebraically.
We want to implement triggers, and transformations all locally, disregarding global changes using sheafs, MorAl algebra locally, Poisson globally.
We will use ladders for waverfront propagation (heat, drugs) and towers with Mittag-leffler for reversible morphisms.

We establish a mathematically rigorous yet computationally
tractable framework for simulating drug-induced topological
phase transitions in neural networks. Building on sheaf the-
ory, Hochschild cohomology, and noncommutative geometry,
we prove that regional pharmacological transformations can be
simulated efficiently while maintaining categorical reversibil-
ity. The key innovations are: (1) a hierarchical ?¯h/Poisson
algebra encoding local quantum effects and global classical be-
havior, (2) pullback/pushforward functors preserving entropy
flows with Bayesian priors, (3) blowup/blowdown operations
resolving pharmacological singularities, and (4) a constructive
proof that the entire structure admits polynomial-time approx-
imation. We demonstrate that drug-receptor interactions in-
duce measurable changes in the Hochschi<img width="1024" height="1024" alt="Gemini_Generated_Image_s6syt0s6syt0s6sy" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9636a34c-892e-4dff-86c9-1ceddd805ca8" />

causal analysis.
